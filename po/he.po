#. We ignore mwm_has_resize_func because WM_NORMAL_HINTS is the
#. * authoritative source for that info. Some apps such as mplayer or
#. * xine disable resize via MWM but not WM_NORMAL_HINTS, but that
#. * leads to e.g. us not fullscreening their windows.  Apps that set
#. * MWM but not WM_NORMAL_HINTS are basically broken. We complain
#. * about these apps but make them work.
