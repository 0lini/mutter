	* src/effects.c: disable opaque animations by default, current 
	implementation suXors.

2001-08-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/effects.c (meta_effects_draw_box_animation): Get start
	time after we do the pixbuf from drawable, so we don't count
	time spent getting pixbuf from drawable in the animation time.

	* src/effects.c: add opaque minimize/shade feature.  The wireframe
	seemed kind of confusing and unclear from a UI standpoint. 
	I know, I know. The bloat begins here.

	Also, we don't need to grab the server during opaque min/shade, 
	which has some nice implications.
	
	* src/ui.c: Add features to render a window with an image in it, 
	and also wrap pixbuf_from_drawable

	* src/effects.c (meta_effects_draw_box_animation): 
	modify to be smoother (at least theoretically) by 
	syncing to current time and "dropping frames" 
	as appropriate.

	* src/window.c (meta_window_shade): draw animation 
	for shading too

2001-08-05  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* src/display.h, src/display.c: Add _NET_WM_ICON_GEOMETRY atom.

	* src/window.c (meta_window_calc_showing): See if the window has
	an icon geometry and show a morphing animation from the window's
	coordinates to the icon's coordinates.
	(meta_window_get_icon_geometry): New function that fetches a
	window's icon geometry.

	* src/Makefile.am: Add effects.[ch].
	
        * src/effects.c: New file with cool effects.

2001-08-03  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/keybindings.c: Add Alt + left/right arrow to 
	move between workspaces.

	* src/screen.c (set_wm_check_hint): put property pointing back to
	itself on the _WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK window.

2001-08-03  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>
	
	* src/display.c (event_callback): push error trap around configure 
	of withdrawn window, fixes a crash caused by rapidly
	creating/destroying a window.

	* src/window.c (recalc_window_features): don't allow shading
	undecorated windows.

	* src/wm-tester/main.c: add a program to torture window managers.
	
2001-08-01  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (recalc_window_features): if a window isn't
	resizeable, turn off maximize function. If min size is equal to
	max size, turn off resize function.
