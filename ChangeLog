	* src/tabpopup.c: Switch back to outline.

2001-08-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/tabpopup.c: experiment with window-cover-with-icon
	instead of just the outline; can't decide.

2001-08-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/tabpopup.c: add crackrock window-outlining feature

	* src/session.c (window_type_to_string): handle fullscreen

2001-08-29  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (meta_display_open): wrong atom name -
	_NET_SUPPORTED not _NET_WM_SUPPORTED

	* src/window.c (meta_window_configure_request): geez, why were we
	honoring configure requests for width/height for normal windows. 
	Denied!
	(meta_window_client_message): _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE support, sort of
	(doesn't quite work, acts like owner_events = true?)

	* src/display.c: add _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE atom

2001-08-28  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

        Unbreak tab popup a bit.
	
	* src/stack.c (meta_stack_get_tab_list): add workspace argument
	(meta_stack_get_tab_next): add workspace argument

	* src/window.c: implement recording of the last user-initiated
	window position, so we can magically handle moving panels around
	really nicely.

	* src/wm-tester/main.c (set_up_icon_windows): fix to use new GTK
	API

2001-08-24  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (constrain_position): force fullscreen windows to
	be at 0,0

	* src/ui.c: use NULL colormap to get bitmaps, requires 
	very latest GTK from CVS or it will spew warnings
	and not work.
	
	* src/window.c (constrain_size): disallow larger than screen in
	all cases, even if user has performed a resize operation.
	(constrain_position): keep window boxed onscreen.

	* src/keybindings.c (meta_display_process_key_event): revert an
	earlier change that disabled global keybindings when a grab is in
	effect; instead, only disable global keybindings if a _keyboard_
	grab is in effect. The earlier change was just a broken
	workaround, the problems it fixed should have been solved by the
	addition of XGrabKeyboard() on the metacity keyboard grabs.

	This should fix the problem with
	pick-up-window-and-move-to-another-desktop.

2001-08-23  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (update_icon): attempt to use the mask as well as
	the pixmap. Probably doesn't work so well.

	* src/tabpopup.c: make this look a little nicer

2001-08-22  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (update_mwm_hints): all the MWM flag tests were
	backward

2001-08-22  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (update_icon): half-ass implementation of 
	getting pixmap icons (WM_NORMAL_HINTS and KWM_WIN_ICON). 
	Ignores mask for now, with possibly ugly results for 
	some apps.
	(read_rgb_icon): fixage

2001-08-19  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c: add a "fullscreen" semantic type; if a window
	requests the screen size exactly, and is undecorated, and is not a
	desktop window, we consider it a fullscreen window and keep it on
	top.

	Totally untested.

2001-08-19  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/screen.c (set_supported_hint): we support _NET_WM_ICON

	* src/wm-tester/main.c: add stuff to test _NET_WM_ICON
	(but it doesn't work, so it isn't tested yet)
	
	* src/window.c (update_icon): read _NET_WM_ICON

	* src/screen.c (meta_screen_new): set the WM_ICON_SIZE hint

	* src/tabpopup.c (meta_ui_tab_popup_select): remove assertion

	* src/window.c (meta_window_get_icon_geometry): fix obscure
	memleak

2001-08-19  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (meta_display_grab_window_buttons): remove XSync,
	error traps already do that
	(meta_display_grab_window_buttons): implement

	* src/keybindings.c: 
	src/display.c: wire up the tab window, it rulez!

2001-08-19  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/tabpopup.c: add prototype thingy to display windows we're
	cycling through with tab. Not wired up to keybindings yet.

2001-08-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/effects.c (meta_effects_draw_box_animation): put an XFlush()
	right after starting things moving

2001-08-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_configure_request): 
	(meta_window_move_resize_internal): Make a half-hearted
	not-very-tested attempt to handle window resizes correctly with
	respect to window gravity.

2001-08-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_get_gravity_position): hrm, I fixed
	this wrong the other day. Fixes static gravity when moving
	windows.

2001-08-18  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/ui.c (meta_image_window_set_position): also set the current
	size. Lame hack of the day.

	* src/effects.c (effects_draw_box_animation_timeout): use the
	delay exposes feature to avoid the screen dirt

	* src/ui.c
	(meta_ui_push_delay_exposes):
	(meta_ui_pop_delay_exposes): feature to let us delay redraws until
	after we do server-grabbed draw-on-inferiors effects

2001-08-17  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_get_gravity_position): fix for
	StaticGravity

2001-08-09  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (meta_window_configure_request): Honor USPosition
	even post-map. I know I'll regret this.

2001-08-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/display.c (meta_display_open): set _NET_WM_NAME 
	hint as a UTF8_STRING not STRING. Patch from Anders.

2001-08-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* src/effects.c: disable opaque animations by default, current 
	implementation suXors.

2001-08-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/effects.c (meta_effects_draw_box_animation): Get start
	time after we do the pixbuf from drawable, so we don't count
	time spent getting pixbuf from drawable in the animation time.

2001-08-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/effects.c: add opaque minimize/shade feature.  The wireframe
	seemed kind of confusing and unclear from a UI standpoint. 
	I know, I know. The bloat begins here.

	Also, we don't need to grab the server during opaque min/shade, 
	which has some nice implications.
	
	* src/ui.c: Add features to render a window with an image in it, 
	and also wrap pixbuf_from_drawable

	* src/effects.c (meta_effects_draw_box_animation): 
	modify to be smoother (at least theoretically) by 
	syncing to current time and "dropping frames" 
	as appropriate.

	* src/window.c (meta_window_shade): draw animation 
	for shading too

2001-08-05  Anders Carlsson  <andersca@gnu.org>

	* src/display.h, src/display.c: Add _NET_WM_ICON_GEOMETRY atom.

	* src/window.c (meta_window_calc_showing): See if the window has
	an icon geometry and show a morphing animation from the window's
	coordinates to the icon's coordinates.
	(meta_window_get_icon_geometry): New function that fetches a
	window's icon geometry.

	* src/Makefile.am: Add effects.[ch].
	
        * src/effects.c: New file with cool effects.

2001-08-03  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/keybindings.c: Add Alt + left/right arrow to 
	move between workspaces.

	* src/screen.c (set_wm_check_hint): put property pointing back to
	itself on the _WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK window.

2001-08-03  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>
	
	* src/display.c (event_callback): push error trap around configure 
	of withdrawn window, fixes a crash caused by rapidly
	creating/destroying a window.

	* src/window.c (recalc_window_features): don't allow shading
	undecorated windows.

	* src/wm-tester/main.c: add a program to torture window managers.
	
2001-08-01  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* src/window.c (recalc_window_features): if a window isn't
	resizeable, turn off maximize function. If min size is equal to
	max size, turn off resize function.
