	happens when you keep old tree around.

2006-12-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.h:
	* clutter/clutter-color.c: Add clutter_color_to_string(),
	which creates a hex-encoded color string from a ClutterColor.

2006-12-20  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* NEWS:
	Add some missing improvements.

2006-12-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-label.c: Remove some gtk-isms; always take
	a reference before calling g_object_notify(), as the object
	might get disposed while calling the closures inside the
	notify queue; notify the changes of the ellipsize property.

2006-12-14  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.h:
	* clutter/clutter-color.c: Expose clutter_color_copy()
	and clutter_color_free() for the python bindings, so that
	they can manager the conversion automatically; use the
	slice allocator when copying/freeing a ClutterColor.

2006-12-13  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.h:
	* clutter/clutter-color.c: Add clutter_color_equal(),
	a function for comparing two colors.

	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c:
	(clutter_rectangle_set_color),
	(clutter_rectangle_set_border_color): Unset the border if
	the color of the rectangle and the color of the border are

2006-12-13  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-clone-texture.c:
	* clutter/clutter-event.h:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	* clutter/clutter-texture.c:
	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c: Update the inline apidoc.

2006-12-13  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: (clutter_actor_class_init):
	Allow actor x,y props to be negative.

2006-12-12  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Rework part of the show/hide machinery.  Allow groups sub-classes
	and composite actors to override show_all/hide_all in order to
	decide which children they wish to show/hide.  This means that
	if an actor overrides the default show/hide virtual methods, it'll
	have to chain up to the parent class show/hide.  While we're at it,
	provide the fully recursive clutter_actor_show_all() and
	clutter_actor_hide_all() methods.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c: Add apidoc for the ClutterKnot
	functions; add pathological equality case for clutter_knot_equal().

	* clutter/clutter-event.h:
	* clutter/clutter-feature.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.c:Fix parameters name so that
	gtk-doc doesn't complain.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-event.c: Add apidoc

	* clutter/clutter-actor.h:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Add a clutter_actor_show_all() and a
	clutter_actor_hide_all() functions; provide a mechanism for
	groups and composited actors to programmatically select what to
	show/hide when clutter_actor_show_all() and clutter_actor_hide_all()
	are called.  If you are overriding the ClutterActor::show or
	the ClutterActor::hide virtual methods you should chain up with
	the parent class.

	* clutter/clutter-group.c: Override show_all and hide_all and
	recursively show/hide every child inside the group;
	clutter_group_show_all() and clutter_group_hide_all() remain as non
	recursive versions of clutter_actor_show_all() and
	clutter_actor_hide_all() (maybe we should rename them in order
	to avoid name clashes with the bindings).

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	* clutter/clutter-texture.c: Chain up with parent class show
	and hide vfuncs.

	* clutter/clutter-clone-texture.h:
	* clutter/clutter-clone-texture.c: Provide API for changing the
	parent texture of a clone texture actor.

	* examples/behave.c:
	* examples/super-oh.c:
	* examples/test.c: Use clutter_actor_show_all() instead of
	clutter_group_show_all().

2006-12-08  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter.doap:
	Put release date in correct format.

2006-12-08  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.h: Add a function prototype
	for the foreach function: we need something more specific
	than GFunc; add clutter_behaviour_get_actors(), used to
	get a list of the actors.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c: Add debugging notes; add
	a warning for behaviour implementations missing the
	alpha_notify vfunc; add api documentation

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.c: Reimplement the
	alpha_notify functions using the new foreach function
	and, where possible, by directly iterating on the
	actors: this shaves off the number of recalculations
	of the property/alpha values, and the number of
	functions.

2006-12-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c: Forgot to set the
	pencil color.

2006-12-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* behave.c: Add test for clutter_color_parse().

2006-12-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-event.c: Move the apidoc out.

2006-12-05  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-color.h:
	* clutter/clutter-color.c: Add clutter_color_parse(),
	which parses a string containing a color definition as
	understood by XParseColor() (or pango_color_parse()).

2006-12-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Avoid clutter segfaulting when used without invoking
	clutter_init().  This is needed when using api documentation
	tools and every other tool relying on the GObject
	introspection API (esp. on a headless box).  see the
	note in clutter/clutter-feature.c:clutter_feature_init
	for a full explanation.

	* clutter/clutter-feature.c: Call clutter_feature_init()
	when needed by one of the accessors of the features
	structure.

	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	* clutter/clutter-private.h: Remove clutter_feature_init()
	public declaration: the features support check is done the
	first time a feature is needed.

	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Do not ever access the clutter
	main context pointer directly; instead, obtain a pointer
	to it via clutter_context_get_default(), which will always
	return something valid.

2006-12-04  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-private.h: Add our own READABLE,
	WRITABLE and READWRITE paramspec flags, declaring the
	string components of the properties GParamSpec as static;
	this should shave off some bytes in the memory footprint
	and avoid relocations.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behavuour-scale.c:
	* clutter/clutter-clone-texture.c:
	* clutter/clutter-label.c:
	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	* clutter/clutter-texture.c:
	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c: Use the CLUTTER_PARAM_*
	macros we just added.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.c: Add properties for
	the scale begin, scale end and gravity parameters.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.h: Mark the ClutterKnot
	memory management functions as public (for the bindings),
	since we use the slice allocator for copying knots around;
	add a clutter_knot_equal() function.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c:
	(node_distance): Use clutter_knot_equal() as a fast path
	to avoid the sqrt() in case the nodes we are using are
	at the same position.
	(path_total_length): Additional check on the existence
	of the next node.

	* examples/behave.c: Do not leak the ClutterBehaviour
	objects around.

2006-12-03  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-texture.h: Clean up.

	* clutter/clutter-texture.c: Typo fix in the name
	of ClutterTextureTileDimension.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c: Allow passing NULL
	to clutter_behaviour_set_alpha() (as we pass NULL
	in the finalize process).

2006-12-02  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-version.h.in: Fix a stupid logic
	error in the CHECK_VERSION macro.

2006-11-30  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter.doap:
	Updates

2006-11-30  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-stage.h:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	(clutter_stage_swap_buffers): Remove, as the same is done
	via clutter_redraw() and clutter_actor_queue_redraw().

	(clutter_stage_unrealize), (clutter_stage_init),
	(clutter_stage_set_xwindow_foreign): Do not call
	XDestroyWindow() on the stage Window if we are using a
	foreign Window, as we don't control its lifetime.

2006-11-30  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* Makefile.am: Remove the gtk directory from the SUBDIRS.

	* clutter/clutter-stage.h:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c: Add clutter_stage_swap_buffers(),
	which swaps the GL buffers.  This fixes the redraw in the
	GTK widget.

2006-11-29  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	(clutter_stage_set_xwindow_foreign): Add checks;
	remove an indirection to the private data.

2006-11-29  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* gtk/*
	* configure.ac:
	* Makfile.am: Remove the GTK+ widget from the
	main tree; now Clutter depends just on GLib,
	XLibs, GdkPixbuf and OpenGL.

2006-11-29  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-stage.c: (clutter_stage_realize):
	Set colormap on stage window - should fix issues
	with indirect rendering.

2006-11-23  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-debug.h:
	Fix small macro typo.

2006-11-22  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-actor.c:
	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.c:
	* clutter/clutter-clone-texture.c:
	* clutter/clutter-feature.c:
	* clutter/clutter-label.c:
	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c:
	* clutter/clutter-texture.c
	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c:
	* clutter/clutter-debug.h:
	Make CLUTTER_NOTE() just take a string rather than a func.
	Add more default context to output.

	* configure.ac:
	Fix flag and add more help docs for --ebable-debug option.

2006-11-21  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Add a --g-fatal-warnings switch
	for abort()-ing on warnings and criticals.

2006-11-21  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Enable debug messages also when
	--enable-debug is set to "minimum".

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/clutter-debug.h: Move all debugging macros inside
	this private header; make all debug macros depend on the
	CLUTTER_ENABLE_DEBUG compile time define, controlled by
	the --enable-debug configure switch; add G_LOG_DOMAIN define.

	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Clean up the debug stuff; add
	command line argument parsing using GOption; the debug
	messages now are triggered like this:

	  CLUTTER_DEBUG=section:section:... clutter-app
	
	or like this:

	  clutter-app --clutter-debug=section:section:...
	
	where "section" is one of the sections listed in clutter-main.c,
	or "all", for all sections; each section is bound to a flag,
	which can be used to define a domain when adding a debug note
	using the CLUTTER_NOTE() macro; the old CLUTTER_DBG() macro is
	just a wrapper around that, under the CLUTTER_DEBUG_MISC domain;
	CLUTTER_NOTE() is used like this:

	  CLUTTER_NOTE (DOMAIN, log-function);
	
	where log function is g_printerr(), g_message(), g_warning(),
	g_critical() or directly g_log() - for instance:

	  CLUTTER_NOTE (PANGO, g_warning ("Cache miss: %d", glyph));

	will print the warning only if the "pango" flag has been
	set to the CLUTTER_DEBUG envvar or passed to the --clutter-debug
	command line argument.

	similar to CLUTTER_SHOW_FPS, there's also the --clutter-show-fps
	command line switch; also, the --display and --screen command
	line switches have been added: the first overrides the DISPLAY
	envvar and the second controls the X screen used by Clutter to
	get the root window on the display.

	* clutter/clutter-main.h:
	* clutter/clutter-main.c: Add extended support for GOption
	in Clutter; use clutter_init_with_args() to let Clutter
	parse your own command line arguments; use instead
	clutter_get_option_group() to get the GOptionGroup used by
	Clutter if you want to do the parsing yourself with
	g_option_context_parse(). The init sequence has been verified,
	updated and moved into common functions where possible.

	* clutter/pango/pangoclutter-render.c:
	* clutter/*.c: Include "clutter-debug.h" where needed; use
	CLUTTER_NOTE() instead of CLUTTER_DBG().

	* examples/super-oh.c: Use the new clutter_init_with_args()
	function, and add a --num-hands command line switch to
	the SuperOH example code controlling the number of hands at
	runtime.

2006-11-21  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* configure.ac: Rename G_ENABLE_DEBUG to CLUTTER_ENABLE_DEBUG.

2006-11-20  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.h:
	* clutter/clutter-rectangle.c: Add border to the ClutterRectangle
	actor; add "border-width", "border-color" and "has-border"
	properties, plus their accessors.  The border generation code is
	pretty lame, at the moment.

	* examples/behave.c: Add code to test the new rectangle properties.

2006-11-20  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter.doap:
	Add an initial DOAP file to project

2006-11-20  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/clutter.h:
	* clutter/clutter-version.h.in: Auto-generated versioning macros.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.h:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Add a ClutterActor::parent-set signal,
	for notificating changes of an actor's parent; add api-doc for
	the actor's properties; add the ClutterActor "name" property; clean
	up a bit some functions; emit the "parent-set" signal when setting
	te parent and when unparenting; better warnings when lowering
	and raising an actor.

	* configure.ac:
	* clutter/Makefile.am: Add a --enable-debug configure option,
	with three levels of debugging: no, minimum and yes; default
	for development releases (odd minor version) is "yes"; update
	the version m4 defines; update the libtool macros: now just
	changed the clutter_interface_age when releasing will update
	everything else.

2006-11-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c: Add "since" strings; add
	a "knot" property which can be used to append a knot to the path;
	fix apidoc.

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c: Add "since" strings.

	* clutter/clutter-feature.c: Add apidoc.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c: Add the "opacity-start"
	and "opacity-end" properties; rewrite constructor to use them.

2006-11-17  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c: Add a "knot-reached" signal,
	which is emitted when the path reaches a node in the nodes list;
	flesh out the documentation a bit; sync the parameters names
	so that gtk-doc doesn't complain about missing stuff.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c: Add the alpha value to the
	ClutterBehaviour::alpha_notify vfunc, so you don't have to
	get the value from the alpha inside the behaviour implementations;
	add more documentation.

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c: Flesh out the description.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.h: Update the header.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.c: Update docs.

2006-11-17  Matthew Allum  <mallum@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.c:
	More docs.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.c:
	More docs, add clutter_behaviour_path_insert_knot(),
	clutter_behaviour_path_remove_knot()

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.h:

	Add clutter alpha sine func

	* clutter/clutter-behaviours.h:

	* clutter/clutter-feature.h:
	* clutter/clutter-main.c:
	Add new experimental sync to vblank code
	Set env CLUTTER_VBLANK=none to disable.

2006-11-16  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-private.h:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Implement the defined
	clutter_actor_reparent() method; call unrealize
	when unparenting an actor.

2006-11-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.h:
	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c: Add a data parameter to
	the ClutterAlphaFunc; add a data+destroy parameter
	to clutter_alpha_set_func() and to clutter_alpha_new(),
	and turned the latter into clutter_alpha_new_full();
	add a simple, empty constructor clutter_alpha_new().

	These changes makes writing bindings a tad more easy,
	as bindings require passing their own functions in
	order to call the real alpha function.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.h: Clean up the header.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviours.[ch]:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-opacity.[ch]:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-path.[ch]:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour-scale.[ch]: Split the
	ClutterBehaviourPath, ClutterBehaviourOpacity and
	ClutterBehaviourScale into their own files as they
	have been growing a bit. Fix ClutterBehaviourPath
	API.

	* clutter/clutter-media.h: Remove the commented
	"metadata_available" signal: gtk-doc chokes up on that.

	* clutter/clutter-timeline.h:
	* clutter/clutter-timeline.c: Remove the useless
	ClutterTimelineAlphaFunc signature; add missing accessor
	methods for the properties; clean up a bit.

	* clutter/clutter-util.h:
	* clutter/clutter-util.c: Remove unneeded function
	clutter_util_can_create_texture().

	* clutter/clutter-feature.h: Sync the name of
	clutter_feature_get_all() with the name declared
	in clutter-feature.h.

	* clutter/Makefile.am:
	* clutter/clutter.h: Update.

	* examples/behave.c: Update to the new ClutterAlpha
	constructor.

	* examples/super-oh.c: Use the right pointer and avoid
	the compiler making a fuss about it.

2006-11-15  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-alpha.h:
	* clutter/clutter-alpha.c: ClutterAlpha is an initially
	floating object, as it makes sense only when bound to
	a ClutterBehaviour; add checks for public API.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.h:
	* clutter/clutter-behaviour.c: Remove the ClutterBehaviour
	constructor: ClutterBehaviour is an abstract class which
	must be implemented by subclassing; add checks for public
	API; unref the actors on finalize; sink the ClutterAlpha
	object.

	* clutter/clutter-behaviours.h: ClutterKnot is a boxed
	type: add the _get_type() function declaration and the
	type macro.

	than once.

2006-07-27  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	* clutter/clutter-private.h: Move clutter_feature_init()
	declaration here: you shouldn't even need to initialise

	* clutter/clutter-feature.c: call clutter_feature_init()
	each time you try to access the feature list; add a static
	lock around the feature flags container; add api documentation.

	properties.

	(clutter_actor_set_clip), (clutter_actor_remove_clip): Emit
	the notification for the changed properties.

	(clutter_actor_has_clip): Simple accessor to the "has-clip"
	property.

2006-07-06  Emmanuele Bassi  <ebassi@openedhand.com>

	Big rework of the actor management semantics: now ClutterActor
	objects behave like GtkObjects - that is they have an initial
	"floating" reference that gets "sunk" when they are added to
	a ClutterGroup.  This makes a group responsible of de-allocating
	each actor inside it, so you just have to destroy the group to
	get every child actor destroyed.  Also, now you can do:

	  clutter_group_add (group, clutter_video_texture_new ());
	
	without having to care about reference counting and explicit
	unreffing.

	* clutter/clutter-private.h: Add private flags setter and
	getter macros.

	* clutter/clutter-actor.h:
	* clutter/clutter-actor.c: Clean up; inherit from GInitiallyUnowned;
	add a "visible" property; add the "destroy", "show" and "hide"
	signals to ClutterActorClass.

	(clutter_actor_show), (clutter_actor_hide): Refactor a bit; emit
	the "show" and "hide" signals.

	(clutter_actor_set_property), (clutter_actor_get_property),
	(clutter_actor_class_init): Implement the "visible" property; add
	signals.

	(clutter_actor_finalize): Do not leak the actor's name, if it is
	set.
	
	(clutter_actor_dispose): Emit the "destroy" signal here.

	(clutter_actor_init): Sink the initial floating flag if needed.

	(clutter_actor_destroy): Add a function to explicitely destroy
	a ClutterActor.

	(clutter_actor_set_parent), (clutter_actor_get_parent),
	(clutter_actor_unparent): Make set_parent require a valid parent;
	add unparent; check on get_parent; ref_sink the actor when
	setting its parent and unref it when unsetting it.  Probably we'll
	need a function that does reparenting as unparent+set_parent in
	a single shot.

	* clutter/clutter-group.h:
	* clutter/clutter-group.c (clutter_group_dispose),
	(clutter_group_finalize), (clutter_group_add),
	(clutter_group_remove): Make the group destroy its children when
	disposing it; clean up, and use the newly-available
	clutter_actor_unparent().

	* clutter/clutter-stage.h:
	* clutter/clutter-stage.c (clutter_stage_init): ClutterStage is
	a top-level actor; clean up.

	* clutter/clutter-video-texture.h:
	* clutter/clutter-video-texture.c: Clean up.

	* examples/super-oh.c:
	* examples/test.c:
	* examples/video-player.c:
	* examples/test-text.c:
	* examples/video-cube.c: Remove the g_object_unref() call, as the
	ClutterStage object is destroyed on clutter_main_quit().
