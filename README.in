Clutter README.
===============

This is Clutter @CLUTTER_VERSION@. Clutter aims to give a nice easy
GObject based API for creating fast, mainly 2D single window stylalised
applications such as media box UI's, presentaions, kiosk style apps etc.
It uses OpenGL for rendering.

Its not meant to be a full featured GUI toolkit for regular desktop
apps nor provide a general interface to *all* OpenGL functionality.

It currently uses fairly low end GL functionality with an aim to still
work well on open source graphics drivers as well as possibly making
an eventual GL ES port feasable.

Clutter currently requires GLib >= 2.10, GdkPixbuf and OpenGL >= 1.2.
Its also recommended you have some kind of working hardware OpenGL on
your target system.

Clutter is LGPL licensed.

RELEASE NOTES

Release Notes for Clutter 0.4
-----------------------------

* The GLX specific API has been moved to the GLX backend code and
  it's now under the ClutterGlx namespace. 

* The priority of the various users of the GLib main loop has been
  reviewed and changed were necessary. Every paint is queued with a
  priority of G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT + 10; timelines are allocated with
  a G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT + 30 priority; events are processed with a
  G_PRIORITY_DEFAUTL priority. This ensures that events are processed
  before the paints take place.

* The ClutterActor::allocate_coords() has been renamed to
  ClutterActor::query_coords(), in order to clarify its usage.

* Actors overriding ClutterActor::request_coords() and
  ClutterActor::query_coords() must convert sizes obtained from the
  public API from pixels to ClutterUnits, using the conversion
  macros found in clutter-units.h. The conversion will be necessary
  until the public API will switch over to returning the generic
  units too.

* Users of Intel video cards should find that disabling sync-to-vblank
  is no longer necessary. In case Clutter applications take really
  long times for redrawing and appear stuck and unresponsive, the
  sync-to-vblank feature might still be the culprit; in that case, use
  CLUTTER_VBLANK=none to disable it and file a bug reporting the video
  card model, the driver version and the X server version.

HACKING
====
If you want to hack on and improve clutter check the TODO file.

BUGS
====

Bugs should be reported to the OpenedHand Bugzilla at:

  http://bugzilla.o-hand.com

Under the product "Clutter".

In the report you should include:
* what system you're running Clutter on;
* which version of GLib, GdkPixbuf and OpenGL you are using;
* which video card and which drivers you are using;
* how to reproduce the bug.

If you cannot reproduce the bug with one of the tests that come with Clutter
source code, you should include a small test case displaying the bad
behaviour.

If the bug exposes a crash, the exact text printed out and a stack trace
obtained using gdb are greatly appreciated.

PATCHES
====

Patches should be submitted using Bugzilla. Patches fixing a bug should be
attached to the bug report; patches for new features or for fixing bugs not
yet reported should be attached to a newly opened bug. Patches should always
be in the unified diff format.
