How:
----

You should including the following at the top of your new unit test:
#include "test-conform-common.h"

Instead of a main () function add an entry point with a prototype as follows:

void
test_blah (TestConformSimpleFixture *fixture,
           gconstpointer data)
{

}

Add a TEST_CONFORM_SIMPLE() entry in test-conform-main.c


Notes:
------

NB: A test fails if it exists. (regardless of the exist status)

Don't call clutter_init since that is handled in test-conform-common.c

Make sure you clean up *everything* you create. Noteable things you might miss
include timelines, behaviours, and all actors you add to the stage. This is important because otherwise you can cause cascading failures in other tests.

Use stage = clutter_stage_new () with a corresponding clutter_actor_destroy instead of clutter_stage_get_default ().
