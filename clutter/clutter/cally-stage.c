/**
 * CallyStage:
 *
 * Implementation of the ATK interfaces for a #ClutterStage
 *
 * #CallyStage implements the required ATK interfaces for [class@Clutter.Stage]
 *
 * Some implementation details: at this moment #CallyStage is used as
 * the most similar Window object in this toolkit (ie: emitting window
 * related signals), although the real purpose of [class@Clutter.Stage] is
 * being a canvas. Anyway, this is required for applications using
 * just clutter, or directly [class@Clutter.Stage]
