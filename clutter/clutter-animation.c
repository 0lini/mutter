/**
 * SECTION:clutter-animation
 * @short_description: Simple implicit animations
 *
 * #ClutterAnimation is an object providing simple, implicit animations
 * for #GObject<!-- -->s.
 *
 * #ClutterAnimation instances will bind a #GObject property belonging
 * to a #GObject to a #ClutterInterval, and will then use a #ClutterTimeline
 * to interpolate the property between the initial and final values of the
 * interval.
 *
 * For convenience, it is possible to use the clutter_actor_animate()
 * function call which will take care of setting up and tearing down
 * a #ClutterAnimation instance and animate an actor between its current
 * state and the specified final state.
 *
 * #ClutterAnimation is available since Clutter 1.0

/**
 * clutter_actor_animate:

 * @first_property_name: the name of a property
 * @VarArgs: a %NULL terminated list of property names and
 *   property values
 *
 * Animates the given list of properties of @actor between the current
 * value for each property and a new final value. The animation has a
 * definite duration and a speed given by the @mode.
 *
 * For example, this:
 *
 * |[
 *   clutter_actor_animate (rectangle, CLUTTER_LINEAR, 250,
 *                          "width", 100,
 *                          "height", 100,
 *                          NULL);
 * ]|
 *
 * will make width and height properties of the #ClutterActor "rectangle"
 * grow linearly between the current value and 100 pixels, in 250 milliseconds.
 *
 * The animation @mode is a logical id, either from the #ClutterAnimationMode
 * enumeration of from clutter_alpha_register_func().
 *
 * All the properties specified will be animated between the current value
 * and the final value. If a property should be set at the beginning of
 * the animation but not updated during the animation, it should be prefixed
 * by the "fixed::" string, for instance:
 *
 * |[
 *   clutter_actor_animate (actor, CLUTTER_EASE_IN, 100,
 *                          "rotation-angle-z", 360,
 *                          "fixed::rotation-center-z", &amp;center,
 *                          NULL);
 * ]|
 *
 * Will animate the "rotation-angle-z" property between the current value
 * and 360 degrees, and set the "rotation-center-z" property to the fixed
 * value of the #ClutterVertex "center".
 *
 * This function will implicitly create a #ClutterAnimation object which
 * will be assigned to the @actor and will be returned to the developer
 * to control the animation or to know when the animation has been
 * completed.
 *
 * Calling this function on an actor that is already being animated
 * will cause the current animation to change with the new final values,
 * the new easing mode and the new duration - that is, this code:
 *
 * |[
 *   clutter_actor_animate (actor, 250, CLUTTER_LINEAR,
 *                          "width", 100,
 *                          "height", 100,
 *                          NULL);
 *   clutter_actor_animate (actor, 500, CLUTTER_EASE_IN_CUBIC,
 *                          "x", 100,
 *                          "y", 100,
 *                          "width", 200,
 *                          NULL);
 * ]|
 *
 * is the equivalent of:
 *
 * |[
 *   clutter_actor_animate (actor, 500, CLUTTER_EASE_IN_CUBIC,
 *                          "x", 100,
 *                          "y", 100,
 *                          "width", 200,
 *                          "height", 100,
 *                          NULL);
 * ]|
 *
 * <note>Unless the animation is looping, it will become invalid as soon
 * as it is complete. To avoid this, you should keep a reference on the
 * returned value using g_object_ref(). If you want to keep the animation
 * alive across multiple cycles, you also have to add a reference each
 * time the #ClutterAnimation::completed signal is emitted.</note>
 *
 * Since the created #ClutterAnimation instance attached to @actor
 * is guaranteed to be valid throughout the #ClutterAnimation::completed
 * signal emission chain, you will not be able to create a new animation
 * using clutter_actor_animate() on the same @actor from within the
 * #ClutterAnimation::completed signal handler. Instead, you should use
 * clutter_threads_add_idle() to install an idle handler and call
 * clutter_actor_animate() in the handler, for instance:

 *   queue_animation (gpointer data)
