/**
 * SECTION:cogl-vertex-buffer
 * @short_description: An API for submitting extensible arrays of vertex
 *		       attributes to be mapped into the GPU for fast
 *		       drawing.
 *
 * For example to describe a textured triangle, you could create a new cogl
 * vertex buffer with 3 vertices, and then you might add 2 attributes for each
 * vertex:
 * <orderedlist>
 * <listitem>
 * a "gl_Position" describing the (x,y,z) position for each vertex.
 * </listitem>
 * <listitem>
 * a "gl_MultiTexCoord0" describing the (tx,ty) texture coordinates for each
 * vertex.
 * </listitem>
 * </orderedlist>
 *
 * The Vertex Buffer API is designed to be a fairly raw mechanism for
 * developers to be able to submit geometry to Cogl in a format that can be
 * directly consumed by an OpenGL driver and mapped into your GPU for fast
 * re-use. It is designed to avoid repeated validation of the attributes by the
 * driver; to minimize transport costs (e.g. considering indirect GLX
 * use-cases) and to potentially avoid repeated format conversions when
 * attributes are supplied in a format that is not natively supported by the
 * GPU.
 *
 * Although this API does allow you to modify attributes after they have been
 * submitted to the GPU you should be aware that modification is not that
 * cheap, since it implies validating the new data and potentially the
 * OpenGL driver will need to reformat it for the GPU.
 *
 * If at all possible think of tricks that let you re-use static attributes,
 * and if you do need to repeatedly update attributes (e.g. for some kind of
 * morphing geometry) then only update and re-submit the specific attributes
 * that have changed.
 */

/**
 * cogl_vertex_buffer_add:
 * @handle: A vertex buffer handle
 * @attribute_name: The name of your attribute. It should be a valid GLSL
 *		    variable name and standard attribute types must use one
 *		    of following built-in names: (Note: they correspond to the
 *		    built-in names of GLSL)
 *		    <itemizedlist>
 *		    <listitem>"gl_Color"</listitem>
 *		    <listitem>"gl_Normal"</listitem>
 *		    <listitem>"gl_MultiTexCoord0, gl_MultiTexCoord1, ..."</listitem>
 *		    <listitem>"gl_Vertex"</listitem>
 *		    </itemizedlist>
 *		    To support adding multiple variations of the same attribute
 *		    the name can have a detail component, E.g.
 *		    "gl_Color::active" or "gl_Color::inactive"
 * @n_components: The number of components per attribute and must be 1,2,3 or 4
 * @type: a #CoglAttributeType specifying the data type of each component.
 * @normalized: If GL_TRUE, this specifies that values stored in an integer
 *		format should be mapped into the range [-1.0, 1.0] or [0.0, 1.0]
 *		for unsigned values. If GL_FALSE they are converted to floats
 *		directly.
 * @stride: This specifies the number of bytes from the start of one attribute
 *	    value to the start of the next value (for the same attribute). So
 *	    for example with a position interleved with color like this:
 *	    XYRGBAXYRGBAXYRGBA, then if each letter represents a byte, the
 *	    stride for both attributes is 6. The special value 0 means the
 *	    values are stored sequentially in memory.
 * @pointer: This addresses the first attribute in the vertex array. (This
 *	     must remain valid until you either call
 *	     cogl_vertex_buffer_submit() or issue a draw call.)
 *
 * This function lets you add an attribute to a buffer. You either use one
 * of the built-in names such as "gl_Vertex", or "gl_MultiTexCoord0" to add
 * standard attributes, like positions, colors and normals or you can add
 * custom attributes for use in shaders.
 *
 * The number of vertices declared when calling cogl_vertex_buffer_new()
 * determines how many attribute values will be read from the supplied pointer.
 *
 * The data for your attribute isn't copied anywhere until you call
 * cogl_vertex_buffer_submit(), (or issue a draw call which automatically
 * submits pending attribute changes) so the supplied pointer must remain
 * valid until then. If you are updating an existing attribute (done by
 * re-adding it) then you still need to re-call cogl_vertex_buffer_submit() to
 * commit the changes to the GPU. (Be carefull to minimize the number of calls
 * to cogl_vertex_buffer_submit though.)
 *
 * Note: If you are interleving attributes it is assumed that each interleaved
 * attribute starts no farther than +- stride bytes from the other attributes
 * it is interleved with. I.e. this is ok:
 * <programlisting>
 * |-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0|
 * </programlisting>
 * This is not ok:
 * <programlisting>
 * |- - - - -0-0-0-0-0-0 0 0 0 0|
 * </programlisting>
 * (Though you can have multiple groups of interleved attributes)
