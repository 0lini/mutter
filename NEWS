2.5.0
===

 Thanks to Rob Adams, Owen Taylor, Frederic Crozat, Arvind Samptur,
 Bill Haneman, Akira Tagoh for help with fixes in this release.

 - many new translations
 - fix an infinite loop while holding a server grab triggered by 
   some recent Qt versions doing weird stuff
 - fix bug where Alt+rightclick repeatedly on titlebar resulted 
   in zillions of menus
 - fix Alt+Tab to *actually* put minimized windows at the end, 
   though this was always intended
 - rewrite size/positions constraint code (currently known 
   to be quite buggy, e.g. xmms is hosed)
 - enforce size of at least 1x1 on windows
 - reduce latency of managing new windows still further 
   by using async properties code in more places
 - don't grab keybindings on docks, so gnome-panel 
   can handle them
 - suck in the panel's screenshot and run dialog global 
   bindings
 - lots of improvements to window placement
 - sync max number of workspaces with pager applet
 - fix to keep focus when inside window frame in 
   strict mouse focus mode
 - make it possible to start a reverse tab with 
   shift+alt+tab (vs. alt+tab then shift)
 - fix a multihead issue with constraints between two 
   windows on different heads
 - require GTK+ 2.2.0 and fontconfig
 - default theme is now Simple
 - add visual bell feature
 - incorporate many fixes from 2.4.34
 - other stuff

2.4.13
===

 - we were making all dialogs skip the taskbar, even non-transient 
   ones, though this was supposedly fixed a while ago. Now really
   fixed.
 - change back to Alt+click by default for the window drag feature.
 - assign Alt+F12 to shade window
 - fix not deleting enough workspaces when the number 
   was reduced via the pager config dialog (readams@hmc.edu)
 - don't allow windows under the top panel ever, even if they 
   are tall windows (Arvind)
 - fix up the window layout for directional workspace nav, 
   so you always stop at the edges and always end up 
   where you expect (hp, with tweaks from readams@hmc.edu)
 - focus new windows in mouse focus mode (readams@hmc.edu)
 - support xeyes, oclock, etc. by applying shape mask 
   to the window manager frame (yeah it resizes slow, deal)
 - fix vertical/horizontal maximize
 - handle crossing events resizing for more opaque resize goodness
   (Soeren)
 - add wacky _METACITY_UPDATE_COUNTER experimental extension 
   to do nice opaque resizing (does nothing without a GTK patch)
 - fix a crash setting workspace names
 - fix internationalized WM_NAME reading
