Clutter 0.3.1 (06/07/2007)
========================

 * List of changes between 0.3 and 0.3.1
   o EGL. There are now 2 experimental EGL backends;
     - 'eglx', the former EGL on X11 implementation (now renamed)
     - 'eglnative', a new EGL 'native' backend which supporting non
       X11 EGL implementations (i.e framebuffer).

   o More X error traps in GLX backend.

Clutter 0.3 (29/06/2007)
========================

 * List of changes between 0.2.3 and 0.3
   o Clutter now supports both switchable windowing system and GL backends. 
     Window systems supported include GLX, EGL and SDL. 

     GL support includes OpenGL 1.2+ and OpenGL ES 1.1. This is
     provided by a small basic abstraction layer 'cogl.h'. Cogl is not
     yet documented - usage external to Clutter is not yet advised.

     Backends may provide specific command line options.

     Notes;

     GLX 
     --- 
     The GLX backend is built by default and is currently the most
     developed, supported and featured windowing system backend. Only
     OpenGL is supported via GLX.

     SDL
     ---
     Clutter has experimental support for using SDL. Open GL is supported as
     is OpenGL ES via Dogles (very experimental).

     EGL
     --- 
     Clutter has experimental support for using EGL. Only Open GL ES
     is supported by EGL.

     EGL support assumes an EGL implementation running atop X Windows. 

     Open GL ES.
     -----------

     Clutter now has experimental support for Open GL ES. 
     Current known issues;

     + Unrealising a ClutterTexture will not move pixel data from video
       into system memory but simply destroy it.
     + BGRA, YUV Texture data not currently supported.

     (Use the clutter_feature API to probe for above at runtime)

     Open Source ES implementations this has been tested against
     include `Vincent' and `dgles'.  Support for commerical
     implementations may require modifications to the configure.ac
     script.

              (Also see: http://svn.o-hand.com/repos/misc/trunk/ogles/ )

     dgles: http://developer.hybrid.fi/dgles/index.html

   o New ClutterEffect class provides a simplified (and thus less flexible)
     API wrapping around behaviours, alphas and timelines.
   o New Behaviours - bspline, ellipsis, rotation.
   o New built in Alpha functions;
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_INC       
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_DEC       
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_HALF      
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SQUARE         
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SMOOTHSTEP_INC 
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SMOOTHSTEP_DEC 
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_EXP_INC        
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_EXP_DEC        
   o New Actors and interfaces
     + ClutterLayout, for writing extended layout support in actors
     + ClutterContainer, for generic container actors
     + ClutterBox, ClutterVBox and ClutterHBox layout actors.
     + ClutterEntry, text entry actor
   o ClutterTexture now handles BGRA, YUV and premultiplied alpha data.
   o All internal math now fixed point based.
   o Clutter now has it own internal event queue.
   o ClutterStage new features;
     + Title property for naming in window decorations.
     + Perspective setting - The stages perspective can now be modified.
   o New Clutter_actor *project API calls allow for querying of tranformed
     actor vertices and points.
   o New Clutter Feature checks.   
   o Initial ClutterUnit implementation for device independant positioning.  
 * List of Bugs fixed
   o Various issues with very poor performance and Intel drivers.
   o #138 Fix typo in x rotation transform.

Clutter 0.2.3 (2007-04-11)
==========================

 * List of changed between 0.2.2 and 0.2.3
   o Fixes to tile based textures and again clutter_texture_get_pixbuf(). [Matthew]
   o Implement Gravity for ClutterScaleBehaviour. [Matthew, Rob]

Clutter 0.2.2 (2007-03-22)
==========================

 * List of changed between 0.2.1 and 0.2.2
   o Addition of basic XEMBED support for clutter stage. [Matthew]
   o Fixes to clutter_texture_get_pixbuf(). [Matthew]
   o Export clutter_group_remove_all and add associated fixes. [Matthew]

Clutter 0.2.1 (2007-02-07)
==========================

 * List of changed between 0.2.0 and 0.2.1
   o Add even faster double to integer (and back) conversion
     functions. [Tomas]
   o Fix some errors in the fixed point sine waveform
     function. [Tomas]
   o Use fixed point math in the Pango renderer. [Tomas]
   o Improve the GL version check. [Matthew]
   o Add a square waveform function. [Emmanuele]
 * List of bugs fixed
   o #215 - macro CLUTTER_MARK() not disabled for non-debug builds

Clutter 0.2 (18-01-2007)
========================

 * List of changes between 0.2 and 0.1
   o Bindings, GStreamer and GTK+ dependencies moved out of tree:
     now Clutter strictly depends on Xlibs, OpenGL and GdkPixbuf only.
   o Actors now have an initial floating reference; this means you
     don't have to explicitely unref them: every memory an actor
     allocates will be freed when the group containing the actor will
     be destroyed.
   o Add basic run-time detection of GL features.
     + Use GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB if available.
     + Attempt to set up sync to vblank (set CLUTTER_VBLANK=none to disable)
   o Add API for behaviours. A ClutterBehaviour is an object which
     drives a set of actors using one or more properties depending
     on the value of an "alpha" function.
     + Provide simple behaviours: ClutterBehaviourOpacity,
       ClutterBehaviourPath and ClutterBehaviourScale.
     + Provide simple alpha functions for ramps and sine waveforms.
   o Add fixed point API for embedded platforms with no FPU.
   o Add support for command line switches to Clutter, like debug
     flags and abort on warnings; also allow application to hook up
     into the initialisation sequence to add their own command line
     switches.
   o Add Pango GL renderer for Clutter, and use it to render text
     inside the ClutterLabel actor; this decrease texture memory
     usage. 
   o Redo Clutter Label widget, using the new Pango renderer.
   o Clutter Textures do not store local pixbuf copy (of texture).
   o Redo group and actor scale/sizing API and functionality.
   o Add memory management API for ClutterColor, and string parsing.
 * List of bug fixed
   o #199 - Little group handling fix?
   o #198 - Detect NPOT support on more systems
   o #197 - Tiled textures are broken
   o #196 - Rebuild the examples when the library changes
   o #156 - clutter_actor_set_position not using the absolute size
   o #155 - Don't test for XInitThreads [Bastien Nocera]
   o #154 - Key presses not working in super-oh example [Bastien Nocera]
   o #152 - Misc fixes [Bastien Nocera]
   o #143 - Faulty ref-counting in clutter_group_remove [Frederic Riss]
   o #141 - Copy-pasto in clutter_media_set_volume [Frederic Riss]
   o #101 - No package 'x11' found -- wrong configure [Tomasz Torcz]
   o  #98 - Enabling trails in super-oh crashes

   o Some simple examples ( also see OPT ).
   o An experimental GTK-Clutter widget.
   o Fairly complete Python bindings.
   o Non complete but hopefully useful API documentation.
