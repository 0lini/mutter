   o

 * List of bug fixes

   o 

Clutter 0.6.0 (18/02/2008)
==========================

 * List of changes between 0.5.6 and 0.6.0

   o New documentation sections inside the API reference, describing
     the animation framework.

   o New API in ClutterActor for computing the actor's vertices in
     the plane of a given ancestor and accessors to query whether an
     actor is scaled or rotated

 * List of bug fixed

   o #613 - Extend point transformation API
   o #779 - Rounding error in ClutterBehaviourScale [Havoc Pennington]
   o #787 - tiled textures are broken
   o #796 - segmentation fault when setting label text

Clutter 0.5.6 (11/02/2008)
==========================

 * List of changes between 0.5.4 and 0.5.6

   o Reverted a last minute change in the depth sorting function of
     ClutterGroup.

   o Added the clutter_actor_move_anchor_point() family of functions,
     which will set the anchor point at the given coordinates while
     adjusting the actor postion so that the relative position of the
     actor toward its parent remains the same.

   o Provide a fallback for finding the Clutter alpha functions inside
     a UI definition for ClutterScript in case g_module_open() fails.

   o Add initial Frame Buffer Objects support in ClutterTexture; using
     FBOs, where supported by the hardware and drivers, it's possible to
     create a ClutterTexture from any actor.

 * List of bugs fixed

   o #386 - Stage is white unless a timeline is present
   o #439 - timing related pong lockup due to timeline rewind...
   o #440 - 1 pixel line flickering
   o #442 - Shader support
   o #451 - Improve font rendering quality (Pango)
   o #452 - Textures are shown with distortion on Solaris/SPARC
   o #526 - OSX backend
   o #533 - Clutter stage is not shown under some conditions
   o #540 - ClutterStage isn't always respecting requests to change size

   o #635 - Fix buffer overflow in clutter_texture_get_pixbuf() [Gwenole
     Beauchesne]
   o #643 - Superfluous "filter-quality" setting in texture_upload_data()?
     [Gwenole Beauchesne]
   o #689 - Rotating actor through layers does not handle opacity
     correctly [Josh Stewart]

   o #769 - OSX backend fails to build
   o #770 - OSX: passing incompatible pointer type

Clutter 0.5.4 (25/01/2008)
==========================

 * List of changes between 0.5.2 and 0.5.4

   o A clutter-x11-<major>.<minor> pkg-config file is installed along
     with the clutter-<major>.<minor> and clutter-<backend>-<major>.<minor>
     ones, for libraries and applications depending on the X11-based
     backends (GLX and EGLX).

   o Textures are correctly unrealized before changing and freeing the
     main GL context.

   o It is now possible to block the automatic call to clutter_main_quit()
     when closing the stage window using the frame controls by connecting
     an handler for the ::event signal on the Clutter stage and checking
     for the CLUTTER_DELETE event type and returning TRUE. This allows
     the usage of other main loops with GLib reactors (like Python's twisted)
     with Clutter without triggering assertions by closing the stage window.

 * List of bugs fixed

   o #564 - Add more precise clutter_qdivx() [Gwenole Beauchesne]
   o #614 - ClutterActor API inconsistencies
   o #640 - ClutterTexture unrealized with no GL context

   o #714 - clutter_event_copy for enter/leave event generates
     extra unref [Neil Roberts]
   o #715 - Type errors in test-shader
   o #720 - BehaviourScale not working in python after recent
     API change [Josh Stewart]

Clutter 0.5.2 (14/01/2008)
==========================

 * List of changes between 0.5.0 and 0.5.2

   o ClutterModelDefault has been renamed to ClutterListModel

   o ClutterModel now has vector-based variants for append, prepend and
     insert methods; these methods are useful for bindings

   o Add units-based variant for clutter_actor_move_by()

 * List of bugs fixed

   o #694 - Handle GLhandleARB on OS X [Tommi Komulainen]
   o #700 - Fix for clutter_effect_rotate() [Neil Roberts]

Clutter 0.5.0 (02/01/2008)
==========================

 * List of changes between 0.4.2 and 0.5.0

   o New event handling system: every actor with the CLUTTER_ACTOR_REACTIVE
     flag set will receive events from the underlying backend; the event
     propagation chain will be walked in two directions (from the actor to
     the top-level container and back) with the ability to block it in
     both phases.

   o ClutterShader, an abstraction over the programmable OpenGL pipeline.

   o ClutterScore, an object for controlling timelines; using a score
     instance is possible to start multiple timelines at once, or start
     a timeline after another has emitted the ::complete signal.

   o ClutterScript, an object for parsing a scene from an external file or
     a buffer; the scene is described using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
     every object is defined using its class and properties, and container
     objects can have their children defined as well. It is also possible
     do describe top-level objects such as timelines and behaviours, and to
     automatically connect signal handlers to signal names.

   o ClutterTimelines duration can now be set in milliseconds using the
     :duration property; the default framerate will be used to compute the
     actual duration in frames. The default framerate will be set by the
     backend, and can be overridden by the application.

   o ClutterTimelines direction can now be set using the :direction
     property; a timeline can be set to proceed forward or backward,
     and the direction can also be change while the timeline is still
     running.

   o New, experimental OSX backend.

   o Build environment for MS VisualStudio 2005.

   o ClutterModel, a generic list-based model object that can be used to
     implement actors following the Model-Viewer-Controller design pattern.
     Clutter provides a default implementation of ClutterModel, called
     ClutterModelDefault and using the GSequence data structure from GLib
     to optimize insertion and look up.

   o Add the ability to grab pointer and keyboard events: if an actor
     is set to have a grab it'll be the only one receiving events until
     it releases the grab.

   o Add the ability for an actor to receive the key focus; an actor
     with key focus will always receive the key events, even if it did
     not acquire the keyboard grab.

   o It is now possible to set the GL "fog" (also known as "depth cueing")
     effect on the ClutterStage; if the fog is enabled, actors farther
     away from the view point will fade into the stage background color.

   o Each actor now has an "anchor point", a point defined in the actor's
     coordinate space that will be used as the origin when scaling and
     rotation transformations.

   o Every pixel-based API has been doubled with a corresponding
     ClutterUnits-based function (postfixed with a '-u'), for instance:

       clutter_actor_set_position() - clutter_actor_set_positionu()
       clutter_actor_set_size()     - clutter_actor_set_sizeu()
       clutter_actor_set_depth()    - clutter_actor_set_depthu()

     This allows sub-pixel precision and device independence.

   o The ClutterLabel actor now tries very hard to provide a sane
     default size, if no bounding box has been requested; this fixes
     the :alignment property and allows the addition of the :justify
     property.

   o The SDL backend can now be compiled under win32 with MingW; this
     backend is still marked as experimental.

   o The OSX backend allows the compilation of Clutter under OS X; this
     backend is experimental.

   o Many documentation additions and improvements.

   o Display DPI now honours on backends its can be queried.

   o Various big endian related fixes.

   o ClutterBehaviourEllipse and ClutterBehaviourRotate API and
   internals improvements.

   o Add basic tslib support to eglnative backend (for touchscreen events)

   o clutter_stage_get_actor_at_pos should now work on 16bpp displays.

   o Make ClutterActor GInitiallyUnowned.

   o New ClutterBox API: each box has now a colour and a margin (distance
     between the inner-border and the children); plus, each packed child
     has a padding. Margins and paddings are expressed in ClutterUnits,
     to ease the transition to the device independent units. You can use
     clutter_box_set_default_padding() if you want the same padding for
     each child.

Clutter 0.3.1 (06/07/2007)
========================

 * List of changes between 0.3 and 0.3.1
   o EGL. There are now 2 experimental EGL backends;
     - 'eglx', the former EGL on X11 implementation (now renamed)
     - 'eglnative', a new EGL 'native' backend which supporting non
       X11 EGL implementations (i.e framebuffer).

Clutter 0.3 (29/06/2007)
========================

 * List of changes between 0.2.3 and 0.3
   o Clutter now supports both switchable windowing system and GL backends.
     Window systems supported include GLX, EGL and SDL.

     GL support includes OpenGL 1.2+ and OpenGL ES 1.1. This is
     provided by a small basic abstraction layer 'cogl.h'. Cogl is not
     yet documented - usage external to Clutter is not yet advised.

     Backends may provide specific command line options.

     Notes;

     GLX
     ---
     The GLX backend is built by default and is currently the most
     developed, supported and featured windowing system backend. Only
     OpenGL is supported via GLX.

     SDL
     ---
     Clutter has experimental support for using SDL. Open GL is supported as
     is OpenGL ES via Dogles (very experimental).

     EGL
     ---
     Clutter has experimental support for using EGL. Only Open GL ES
     is supported by EGL.

     EGL support assumes an EGL implementation running atop X Windows.

     Open GL ES.
     -----------

     Clutter now has experimental support for Open GL ES.
     Current known issues;

     + Unrealising a ClutterTexture will not move pixel data from video
       into system memory but simply destroy it.
     + BGRA, YUV Texture data not currently supported.

     (Use the clutter_feature API to probe for above at runtime)

     Open Source ES implementations this has been tested against
     include `Vincent' and `dgles'.  Support for commerical
     implementations may require modifications to the configure.ac
     script.

     vincent: http://ogl-es.sourceforge.net/
              (Also see: http://svn.o-hand.com/repos/misc/trunk/ogles/ )

     dgles: http://developer.hybrid.fi/dgles/index.html

   o New ClutterEffect class provides a simplified (and thus less flexible)
     API wrapping around behaviours, alphas and timelines.
   o New Behaviours - bspline, ellipsis, rotation.
   o New built in Alpha functions;
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_INC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_DEC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SINE_HALF
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SQUARE
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SMOOTHSTEP_INC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_SMOOTHSTEP_DEC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_EXP_INC
      CLUTTER_ALPHA_EXP_DEC
   o New Actors and interfaces
     + ClutterLayout, for writing extended layout support in actors
     + ClutterContainer, for generic container actors
     + ClutterBox, ClutterVBox and ClutterHBox layout actors.
     + ClutterEntry, text entry actor
   o ClutterTexture now handles BGRA, YUV and premultiplied alpha data.
   o All internal math now fixed point based.
   o Clutter now has it own internal event queue.
   o ClutterStage new features;
     + Title property for naming in window decorations.
     + Perspective setting - The stages perspective can now be modified.
   o New Clutter_actor *project API calls allow for querying of tranformed
     actor vertices and points.
   o New Clutter Feature checks.
   o Initial ClutterUnit implementation for device independant positioning.
 * List of Bugs fixed

==========================

 * List of changed between 0.2.2 and 0.2.3
   o Fixes to tile based textures and again clutter_texture_get_pixbuf(). [Matthew]
   o Implement Gravity for ClutterScaleBehaviour. [Matthew, Rob]

Clutter 0.2.2 (2007-03-22)
==========================

 * List of changed between 0.2.1 and 0.2.2
   o Addition of basic XEMBED support for clutter stage. [Matthew]
   o Fixes to clutter_texture_get_pixbuf(). [Matthew]
   o Export clutter_group_remove_all and add associated fixes. [Matthew]

Clutter 0.2.1 (2007-02-07)
==========================

 * List of changed between 0.2.0 and 0.2.1
   o Add even faster double to integer (and back) conversion
     functions. [Tomas]
   o Fix some errors in the fixed point sine waveform
     function. [Tomas]
   o Use fixed point math in the Pango renderer. [Tomas]
   o Improve the GL version check. [Matthew]
   o Add a square waveform function. [Emmanuele]
 * List of bugs fixed
   o #215 - macro CLUTTER_MARK() not disabled for non-debug builds

Clutter 0.2 (18-01-2007)
========================

 * List of changes between 0.2 and 0.1
   o Bindings, GStreamer and GTK+ dependencies moved out of tree:
     now Clutter strictly depends on Xlibs, OpenGL and GdkPixbuf only.
   o Actors now have an initial floating reference; this means you
     don't have to explicitely unref them: every memory an actor
     allocates will be freed when the group containing the actor will
     be destroyed.
   o Add basic run-time detection of GL features.
     + Use GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB if available.
     + Attempt to set up sync to vblank (set CLUTTER_VBLANK=none to disable)
   o Add API for behaviours. A ClutterBehaviour is an object which
     drives a set of actors using one or more properties depending
     on the value of an "alpha" function.
     + Provide simple behaviours: ClutterBehaviourOpacity,
       ClutterBehaviourPath and ClutterBehaviourScale.
     + Provide simple alpha functions for ramps and sine waveforms.
   o Add fixed point API for embedded platforms with no FPU.
   o Add support for command line switches to Clutter, like debug
     flags and abort on warnings; also allow application to hook up
     into the initialisation sequence to add their own command line
     switches.
   o Add Pango GL renderer for Clutter, and use it to render text
     inside the ClutterLabel actor; this decrease texture memory
     usage.
   o Redo Clutter Label widget, using the new Pango renderer.
   o Clutter Textures do not store local pixbuf copy (of texture).
   o Redo group and actor scale/sizing API and functionality.
   o Add memory management API for ClutterColor, and string parsing.
 * List of bug fixed

   o  #98 - Enabling trails in super-oh crashes

Clutter 0.1 (22/06/2006)
========================

 * First 'official' release, expect bugs aplenty.
 * Contains:
   o Hopefully enough functionality to build things.
   o Basic gstreamer 0.10 video playback support.
   o Fairly stable API, though in no way totally stable.
     Expect CHANGES in future versions.
   o Some simple examples ( also see OPT ).
   o An experimental GTK-Clutter widget.
   o Fairly complete Python bindings.
   o Non complete but hopefully useful API documentation.
 * If you want to help out see the TODO file.
