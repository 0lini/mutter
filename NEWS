Clutter 0.2 ()
========================

 * List of changes between 0.2 and 0.1
   o Bindings, GStreamer and GTK+ dependencies moved out of tree:
     now Clutter strictly depends on Xlibs, OpenGL and GdkPixbuf only.
   o Actors now have an initial floating reference; this means you
     don't have to explicitely unref them: every memory an actor
     allocates will be freed when the group containing the actor will
     be destroyed.
   o Add basic run-time detection of GL features.
     + Use GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB if available.
     + Attempt to set up sync to vblank (set CLUTTER_VBLANK=none to disable)
   o Add API for behaviours. A ClutterBehaviour is an object which
     drives a set of actors using one or more properties depending
     on the value of an "alpha" function.
     + Provide simple behaviours: ClutterBehaviourOpacity,
       ClutterBehaviourPath and ClutterBehaviourScale.
     + Provide simple alpha functions for ramps and sine waveforms.
   o Add fixed point API for embedded platforms with no FPU.
   o Add support for command line switches to Clutter, like debug
     flags and abort on warnings; also allow application to hook up
     into the initialisation sequence to add their own command line
     switches.
   o Add Pango GL renderer for Clutter, and use it to render text
     inside the ClutterLabel actor; this decrease texture memory
     usage. 
   o Redo Clutter Label widget, using the new Pango renderer.
   o Clutter Textures do not store local pixbuf copy (of texture).
   o Redo group and actor scale/sizing API and functionality.
   o Add memory management API for ClutterColor, and string parsing.
 * List of bug fixed

   o #155 - Don't test for XInitThreads [Bastien Nocera]
   o #154 - Key presses not working in super-oh example [Bastien Nocera]
   o #152 - Misc fixes [Bastien Nocera]
   o #143 - Faulty ref-counting in clutter_group_remove [Frederic Riss]
   o #141 - Copy-pasto in clutter_media_set_volume [Frederic Riss]
   o #101 - No package 'x11' found -- wrong configure [Tomasz Torcz]
   o #98 - Enabling trails in super-oh crashes

Clutter 0.1 (22/06/2006)
========================

 * First 'official' release, expect bugs aplenty.
 * Contains:
   o Hopefully enough functionality to build things.
   o Basic gstreamer 0.10 video playback support.
   o Fairly stable API, though in no way totally stable. 
     Expect CHANGES in future versions.
   o Some simple examples ( also see OPT ).
   o An experimental GTK-Clutter widget.
   o Fairly complete Python bindings.
   o Non complete but hopefully useful API documentation.
 * If you want to help out see the TODO file.
