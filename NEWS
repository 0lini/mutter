Clutter 0.2 ()
========================

 * List of changes between 0.2 and 0.1
   o Bindings, GStreamer and GTK+ dependencies moved out of tree:
     now Clutter strictly depends on Xlibs, OpenGL and GdkPixbuf only.
   o Actors now have an initial floating reference; this means you
     don't have to explicitely unref them: every memory an actor
     allocates will be freed when the group containing the actor will
     be destroyed.
   o Add run-time detection of GL features.
   o Add API for behaviours. A ClutterBehaviour is an object which
     drives a set of actors using one or more properties depending
     on the value of an "alpha" function.
   o Add group and actor scale API and functionality.
   o Add fixed point API for embedded platforms with no FPU.
   o Add support for command line switches to Clutter, like debug
     flags and abort on warnings; also allow application to hook up
     into the initialisation sequence to add their own command line
     switches.
   o Add Pango GL renderer for Clutter, and use it to render text
     inside the ClutterLabel actor; this will decrease texture memory
     usage.

Clutter 0.1 (22/06/2006)
========================

 * First 'official' release, expect bugs aplenty.
 * Contains:
   o Hopefully enough functionality to build things.
   o Basic gstreamer 0.10 video playback support.
   o Fairly stable API, though in no way totally stable. 
     Expect CHANGES in future versions.
   o Some simple examples ( also see OPT ).
   o An experimental GTK-Clutter widget.
   o Fairly complete Python bindings.
   o Non complete but hopefully useful API documentation.
 * If you want to help out see the TODO file.
