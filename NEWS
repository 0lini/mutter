Clutter 0.1 ( 22/06/2006)
===========

 * First 'official' release, expect bugs aplenty.
 * Contains:
   o Hopefully enough functionality to build things.
   o Basic gstreamer 0.10 video playback support.
   o Fairly stable API, though in no way totally stable. 
     Expect CHANGES in future versions.
   o Some simple examples ( also see OPT ).
   o An experimental GTK-Clutter widget.
   o Fairly complete Python bindings.
   o Non complete but hopefully useful API documentation.
 * If you want to help out see the TODO file.
