    <title>Clutter Overview</title>
    <para>

    Clutter is a GObject based library for creating fast, visually
    rich graphical user interfaces. It is intended for creating single
    window stylalised applications such as media box UI's,
    presentaions, kiosk style apps in preference to regular 'desktop'
    style applications.

    Clutter's underlying graphics rendering is OpenGL ( version 1.2+ )
    based.  The clutter API is intended to be easy to use, attempting
    to hide many of the GL complexitys. It targets maily 2D based
    graphics and is definetly not intended to be a general interface
    for all OpenGL functionality ( yet ).

    <para>

    As well as OpenGL Clutter depends on and uses GLib, GObject,
    GDKPixbuf and GStreamer. Clutter is released under the GNU Library
    General Public License (GNU LGPL)
