/**
 * SECTION:cogl-paths
 * @short_description: Functions for constructing and drawing 2D paths.
 *
 * There are two levels on which drawing with cogl-paths can be used.
 * The highest level functions construct various simple primitive
 * shapes to be either filled or stroked. Using a lower-level set of
 * functions more complex and arbitrary paths can be constructed by
 * concatenating straight line, bezier curve and arc segments.
 *
 * When constructing arbitrary paths, the current pen location is
 * initialized using the move_to command. The subsequent path segments
 * implicitly use the last pen location as their first vertex and move
 * the pen location to the last vertex they produce at the end. Also
 * there are special versions of functions that allow specifying the
 * vertices of the path segments relative to the last pen location
 * rather then in the absolute coordinates.
