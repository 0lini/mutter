===========================

The mingw-cross-compile.sh script in this directory automates cross compilation
of clutter with mingw for win32; it requires to have the mingw cross compiler
installed, but it will point you in the right direction if it cannot find it.
It will also fetch all the necessary dependencies; it build clutter from
svn trunk, so you might want tweak it if you are looking for specific tag.

To cross-compile clutter,

  mkdir build_dir
  cd build_dir
  ./mingw-cross-compile.sh

and follow the prompts.
