
INTRODUCTION
============
Clutter is an open source software library for creating fast, visually rich and animated 
graphical user interfaces. For more information see http://clutter-project.org


BUILDING CLUTTER
================
Currently only building with MSVC is supported (please feel free to contribute a different 
build system.

To build clutter, you will need runtime + dev libraries and headers for:

glib & co.
----------
glib, gobject, gmodule, gdk pixbuf, freetype, fontconfig, pango, pangoft2, gettext, iconv,
expat, these can be found at Tor Lillqvist's site, http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/. 
The simplest way to install the runtimes is probably to install Gimp (http://gimp.org), but 
the dev packages you will need to install by hand (not forgetting to tell your MSVC where 
to look for the includes and libs).

In addition to the libs, you will also need glib-genmarshal and glib-mkenums programs, 
both of which come with the glib developement packages, but make sure that the releveant
bin directory is added to your MSVC path; glib-mkenums is a perl script, so you will also 
need perl installed in MSVC path. Unfortunately, due to the severe limitations of the 
cmd.exe shell, I have ended up hardcoding the location of glib-mkmenus to the custom build 
rules for clutter-enum-types.c.in and clutter-enum-types.h.in, so you will need to edit 
those to match your install (if you can come up with a better way of doing this, patches 
are, of course, welcome).

SDL
---
The windows port uses sdl backend; you can get the necessary files from http://libsdl.org/
(or feel free to write a different backend).

GLee
----
Believe it or not, windows in 2007 only supports OpenGL 1.1 specification (which is a
decade old). Glee is a library by Ben Woodhouse, which wraps the OpenGL extension API
and eliminates the need to load any post 1.1 OpenGL functions (up to standard 2.2) as 
extensions; you can get it from http://elf-stone.com/glee.php.

Known Issues
============

* Could not include clutter-marshal.h: no such a file or directory -- this sometimes happens
for reasons unknown. clutter-marshal.h is generated from the clutter-marshal.list; compiling 
clutter-marshal.list twice in succession usually fixes this.

* test-perspective:
There are some issues with the SDL backend running in fullscreen mode (it does not work).

* test-offscreen:
Offscreen rendering is currently not supported by the SDL backend; feel free to fix this.

* test-textures:
Does not work; unsure of the causes.
