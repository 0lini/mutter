GENERAL
=======

General notes and rules on clutter core hacking;

 - GNU style indentation, please wrap at 80 chars. 

 - All non static public API funcs should be documented in the source files
   via gtk-doc. Structures, enumerations and macros should be documented in
   the header files.

 - All non-trivial static and private API should be documented, especially
   the eventual lifetime handling of the arguments/return values or locking
   of mutexes.

 - All public functions with float parameters should also provide a fixed
   point version. Fixed point should be used internally.

 - All public functions dealing with pixels should also provide a
   ClutterUnit version. ClutterUnit should be used internally.

 - Properties should always be in floating point (never fixed point).
   The precision should be double for unbounded properties (e.g.
   (-MAX_DOUBLE, MAX_DOUBLE)), and single for bounded properties (e.g.:
   [0.0, 1.0]).

 - Public entry points must always check their arguments with
   g_return_if_fail() or g_return_val_if_fail().

 - Private entry points should use g_assert() to verify internal state.

 - Really try to avoid if possible additions to clutter-private.h. Use
   accessor functions instead.

 - Don't add direct GL calls but wrap with cogl (also adding GL ES Version)

 - Use CLUTTER_NOTE() macro for debug statements.

 - New features should also include an exhaustive test unit under tests.


RELEASES
========

In making a new release;

 - Check out a fresh copy from SVN.

 - Verify versioning in configure.ac, increasing relevant
   clutter_major_version/clutter_minor_version/clutter_micro_version
   value. For point releases, bump clutter_micro_version to the next
   even number.

 - If there was no API change (addition, removal), increment
   clutter_interface_age by one. If there was an API change,
   set clutter_interface_age to zero.

 - Update NEWS (New feature details, bug #'s), README (Any API changes
   relevant to developers + version), AUTHORS if relevant.

 - Add a Release entry to the ChangeLog noting version.

 - Call make distcheck and fix if fails. 

 - Upload the tarball.

 - Bump clutter_micro_version to the next odd number version.

 - Commit.
 
 - Announce release to waiting world on blog and mailing list.

 - Release any dependant add-ons following similar rules to above. 
   Dont forget to check *.pc file version deps!
