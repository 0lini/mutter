General notes and rules on clutter core hacking;

 - GNU style indentation, please wrap at 80 chars. 

 - All public functions with float parameters should also provide a fixed
   point version.

 - Propertys should always be float (never fixed). 

 - API funcs should always use g_return_*

 - Really try to avoid if possible additions to clutter-private.h

 - Dont add direct GL calls but wrap with cogl (also adding GL ES Version)
