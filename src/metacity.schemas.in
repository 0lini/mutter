          It has three possible values; "click" means windows must 
          be clicked in order to focus them, "sloppy" means windows
          are focused when the mouse enters the window, and "mouse" means
          windows are focused when the mouse enters the window and 
          unfocused when the mouse leaves the window.

         <long> 
         If true, then Metacity works in terms of applications rather 
         than windows. The concept is a bit abstract, but 
         in general an application-based setup is more like  
         the Mac and less like Windows. When you focus a window 
         in application-based mode, all the windows in the 
         application will be raised. Also, in application-based 
         mode, focus clicks are not passed through to windows 
         in other applications. 
         The existence of this setting is somewhat questionable. 
         But it's better than having settings for all the specific 
         details of application-based vs. window-based, e.g. 
         whether to pass through clicks. Also, application-based mode
         is largely unimplemented at the moment.

                applications</short>
         <long> 
          Some applications break specifications in ways that result
          in window manager misfeatures. For example, ideally Metacity
          would place all dialogs in a consistent position with
          respect to their parent window. This requires ignoring
          application-specified positions for dialogs. But some
          versions of Java/Swing mark their popup menus as dialogs, 
          so Metacity has to disable dialog positioning to allow 
          menus to work in broken Java applications. There are 
          several other examples like this.

          This option puts Metacity in full-on Correct mode, which
          perhaps gives a moderately nicer UI if you don't need to run
          any broken apps. Sadly, workarounds must be enabled by
          default; the real world is an ugly place.

          Some of the workarounds are workarounds for limitations in 
          the specifications themselves, so sometimes a bug 
          in no-workarounds mode won't be fixable without 
          amending a spec.
