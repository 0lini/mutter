/* Mutter is responsible for pulling events off the X queue, so Clutter

 * in the clutter queue. This happens, for example, when clutter generate
 * enter/leave events on mouse motion - several events are queued in the
 * clutter queue but only one dispatched. It could also happen because of
 * explicit calls to clutter_event_put(). We add a very simple custom
 * event loop source which is simply responsible for pulling events off
 * of the queue and dispatching them before we block for new events.
