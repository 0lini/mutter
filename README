Clutter README.
===============

Clutter aims to give a nice easy GObject based API for creating fast,
mainly 2D single window stylalised applications such as media box
UI's, presentaions, kiosk style apps etc. It uses OpenGL for rendering.

Its not meant to be a full featured GUI toolkit for regular desktop
apps nor provide a general interface to *all* openGL functionality.

It currently uses fairly low end GL functionality with an aim to still
work well on open source graphics drivers as well as possibly making
an eventual GL ES port feasable.

Clutter currently requires GLib >= 2.8, GdkPixbuf and OpenGL >= 1.2.
Its also recommended you have some kind of working hardware OpenGL on
your target system.

Clutter is LGPL licensed.

If you want to hack on and improve clutter check the TODO file.
