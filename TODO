0.4 (July 07)
==

Definetly:

 - YUV texture data [DONE] premulled alpha texture data. (ma)
 - Basic layout code. [DONE] (eb)
 - Basic text entry [DONE] (np)
 - Perspective setup [DONE] (ma)
 - API doc fixups (all)
 - main loop scheduling - paints vs timelimes vs events [DONE] ((ma, eb)
 - ClutterProxyTexture (ma)
 - event queue fixups [DONE} (eb) 
 - clutter_actor_get_vertices [Partly DONE?] (tf)
 - fix up event queue [DONE] (eb)

Maybe:

 - SDL event fixups [DONE - roughly]
 - Application developers manual
 - Lookat type functionality.
 - Mipmaps for pango renderer to improving text scaling quality

0.6
===

Definetly:

 - More ClutterUnits support, convert actor API to units.
 - Fragment shader support infrastructure
 - XML/JSON type 'layout' files - include actors + behaviours + timeline etc.
 - App developers manual.
 - Events for Actors
   - Add 'sensitive' property, false by default. Only pick sensitive actors
   - Very simple focus model - actors have a focus flag and if set emit
     key events.
   - Motion events need to be explicitly enabled. 

Nice/Maybe:
===========

 - Improve cogl massively to be be processing like.
 - Gradient support ?
 - Rectangle like props to all actors
 - Glitz integration
 - Some kind of focus model.
 - Apple/Win native backends.
 - ClutterBehaviourDepth (trivial)
 - ClutterTextureAnimation (trivial)
 - Glitz backend over GLX (would cover above)
