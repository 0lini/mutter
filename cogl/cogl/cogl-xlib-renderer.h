/**

 * This function processes a single event; it can be used to hook into
 * external event retrieval (for example that done by Clutter or
 * GDK).
 *
 * Return value: #CoglFilterReturn. %COGL_FILTER_REMOVE indicates that
 * Cogl has internally handled the event and the caller should do no
 * further processing. %COGL_FILTER_CONTINUE indicates that Cogl is
 * either not interested in the event, or has used the event to update
 * internal state without taking any exclusive action.
