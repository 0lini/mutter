This directory contains a number of simple hacks come tests come
examples come clutter demos.

There are:

 o test

   Lots of randomness. Scratchpad to test new features.

 o test.py

   Like above but more randomness in python.

 o super-oh

   Spinning OH logos. Click to dissapear.

 o video-player.
 
   Simple fullscreen video player. 

   - Move mouse to see controls.
   - Hit q or Esc to exit, p to toggle pause state.
   - Has some useless cheesy effects built in.
      - Hit e to flip the video. 

 o video-cube.
 
   Pure evil. A nasty hack to do a video cube with clutter.
   Could be done much nicer.
 

Also see http://svn.o-hand.com/repos/misc/trunk/opt for a simple
clutter based presentation program.
